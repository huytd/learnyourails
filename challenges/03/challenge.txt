<yellow>Run your server</yellow>

Now you have your first Rails application created. It's time to let your server run for the first time.

To start the server, type the command:

> <yellow>rails server</yellow>

Or, with shorter command:

> <yellow>rails s</yellow>

Your server will startup and run on <green>http://localhost:8000</green> by default.

Run your server and verify with the following command to reach the next challenge:

> <yellow>railsme verify</yellow>
